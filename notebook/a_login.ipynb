    "# Selenium Web Automation Example\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS, and its scripts can be written in various programming languages including Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will:\n",
    "1. Set up the Selenium WebDriver.\n",
    "2. Load login credentials from a JSON file.\n",
    "3. Perform the login operation on a specified website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Import Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import the necessary libraries. Here's a brief description of each:\n",
    "- `selenium`: The core library for browser automation.\n",
    "- `webdriver_manager.chrome`: To manage and download the ChromeDriver.\n",
    "- `json`: To read the JSON file containing the login credentials.\n",
    "- `time`: To add delays where necessary.\n"

    "- Fills in the username and password fields.\n",
